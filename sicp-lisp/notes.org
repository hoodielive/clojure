* Imperative Knowledge "How to" -> to find an approximation to square root:
  - Make a Guess G 
  - Improve the guess by averaging g and x/g 
  - Keep improving the guess until it is good enough

* Techniques to control complexity
  - Procedures direct processes 
  - Computer Science isn't real! 

* Black Box Abstraction 
  - Suppress detail into modules
  - Find a fixed point of a function:
    Method for finding a fixed point of a function f (that is, a value Y such that F(Y) = Y)
    - start with a guess for y 
    - keep applying f over and over until the result doesn't change very much 

    Ex.
    To compute square root, find a fixed point of the function Y -> Avergae of Y and X/Y
