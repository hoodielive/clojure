Syntax
  Clojures syntax is simple.
  Like all Lisps..

Forms
  Clojure recognizes 2 kinds of structures:
          Literals/Literal Representations of data structures:
                           i.e. -> numbers, strings, maps and vectors
          Operations
          How you do things..
            taking the form of : opening paranthesis, operator, operands, closing parenthesis
                   (operator operan1 operand2 ... operandn)
            with No commas
            Clojure uses whitespace to separate operands and it treats commas as whitespace

            (+ 1 2 3)
            ; => 6

            (str "It was the panda " "in the library " "with a dust buster")
            ; => "It was the panda in the library with a dust buster"


Control flow/structures:
(if boolean-form
  then-form
  optional-else-form) # used to evaluate a truthy or falsey value
